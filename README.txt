This is a Minecraft mod created by Zhenzi233. It was just used to test the Github library to get familiar with Github. Download the source code and build it.
Construction method:
1. Open build.gradle with IDEA (I am using IDEA 2022.1) (Jdk 8 or Java 8 May need to be installed (I am not familiar with this)
2. Then wait for excruciatingly long download times (for me)
3. Run build/ Build in Gradle
4. Then find Zhenzimod-1.0 in Build/Libs
4. Put it in the. Minecraft/Mods folder with the latest version of Forge Minecraft
